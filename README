Boston Cleanweb Hackathon 2.0
=============


Project Name: EnerNoc Motion
____________________________
In the spirit of Hans Rosling's famous TED talks and his brilliant data visualization, this project tries to combine the same motion chart visualization with the year-long data dump that EnerNoc just released. The amount of new insights gleaned from and the stories told by this data-set(with the use of such visualizations) should act as a call-to-action for more widespread usage of smart meters and/or more open consumption usage database and APIs.

Room For Improvement
____________________

1. Hour by hour resolution playback of the data on the motion chart
2. Better temperature data (daily, geolocated)
3. More dynamic utility rate look up (geolocated, seasonal, peak and off-peak, etc)
4. Larger, more representative consumption data
